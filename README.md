AMPscript functions work in much the same way as they do in Microsoft Excel; that is, parameters are set for a predefined function, which are interpreted and, in turn, return a value. Several AMPscript functions are identical to Excel functions â€“ while some functions are named differently, they share the same parameters and output the same result as Excel.

The example below compares the SUM Excel function with the Add AMPscript function, where two numbers are passed as arguments to the function. In this case, both functions will output the value 3.

=SUM(1,2)
